            Hello! My name is Anthony Iacano, and I am a web developer based out of Northeast Ohio! I am currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development program through Case Western Reserve University
            to continue honing my skills so that I can be the best developer I can be. In the future, I intend to have a career that lets me collaboratively and creatively work with others to create some 
            incredible software and experiences!<br /><br />I hope that I might get the chance to work with you too!
